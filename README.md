# The ùëò-means Clustering Algorithm in MapReduce

#### Cloud Computing Project

## Case Study Description

![Image of Description](various_folder_utils/images/case_study_description.png)

## What we are required to do

1. Design a MapReduce algorithm (using pseudocode) to implement the _k-means_ algorithm;
2. Implement the designed MapReduce algorithm using the Hadoop framework;
3. Test implementations on a synthetic or real-world dataset;
4. Write a short project report detailing your design, implementation and experimental results.

### For higher marks, please address efficiency issues in your implementation; examples include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Use combiners and/or more than 1 reducer;
- Use custom WritableComparable objects;
- Use the Mapper and Reducer classes setup and/or cleanup methods;
- Test your implementation on a range of different datasets, by varying values of ùëõ, ùëë, and ùëò

### Documentation Report

More deteails and final results are presents in the [Final Report Documentation](various_folder_utils/doc/doc_to_be_added.txt)

## Quick Start

#### Login as hadoop user and go out of the root folder with "cd" command line after execute below command

```shell
sudo su -- hadoop
```

#### From the name node start the name node, data nodes and secondary name node with following command

```shell
start-dfs.sh
```
```
Output Expected:
    Starting namenodes on [hadoop-namenode]
    Starting datanodes
    Starting secondary namenodes [hadoop-namenode]
```

#### From the name node start the resource manager and node managers with following command

```shell
start-yarn.sh
```
```
Output Expected:
    Starting resourcemanager
    Starting nodemanagers
```

#### Clean and make new maven package. Run it with the pom.xml is

```shell
mvn clean package
```

#### Hadoop runable - java code kmeans [input_fileDataset_name] [output_folder_name]

```shell
hadoop hadoop jar target/KMeans-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar it.unipi.dii.cc.hadoop.Kmeans points_set_1k.txt output_kmeans_1k
```
